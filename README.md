# 🕌 3D Gol Gumbaz Model using OpenGL

This project is a 3D graphical simulation of the **Gol Gumbaz**, a historical architectural monument, built using **OpenGL** and **GLUT** in **C++**. It visually reconstructs the grandeur of Mughal-era architecture, showcasing domes, arches, and ornamental elements with detailed rendering and transformation techniques.

## 🏛️ About Gol Gumbaz

**Gol Gumbaz**, located in **Bijapur, Karnataka, India**, is the mausoleum of **Sultan Muhammad Adil Shah** (1626–1656) of the Adil Shahi dynasty. It is renowned for:

- Its **massive central dome**—one of the largest in the world.
- The **"Whispering Gallery"**, where even the smallest sound can be heard clearly across the other side of the dome.
- A symmetrical plan, flanked by **octagonal towers** at each corner and a grand central chamber.

This project digitally recreates the grandeur and architectural magnificence of Gol Gumbaz to allow users to experience a virtual walkthrough.
